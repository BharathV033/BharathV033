👋🏻 Hi, I am Bharath V, a sophomore CSE student with a keen interest in the field of psychology. I am driven by a desire to learn and explore the world around me. I am constantly seeking out new perspectives on productivity and enjoy watching videos that offer insights on how to optimise performance. 

📎 In my free time, I spend my time watching badminton and football matches or listening to music or podcasts. I also enjoy watching travel videos to broaden my horizons and gain inspiration for future adventures. Overall, I am a curious and passionate individual who is always seeking new challenges and opportunities to grow.
